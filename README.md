## Discription
The scripts are supported with ZED api (MOST OF THE CODE ARE PROVIDED BY ZED, WITH ONLY NECESSARY CHANGE IN THE PART DEALING WITH DISTANCE). Integrating with Oculus Quest 2, the ZED camera detect the physical QR code and generate virtual AR objects above the code. When sticking the QR code on the mask, the system generates augmentation on face serving as a virtual mask. The scripts are capable to react according to the relative distance between the QR code and the camera, and react correspondingly to such distance. 

(The scripts cannot be used inividually, they need to be implemented together with ZED api. In addition, some of the codes are provided by ZED.)
